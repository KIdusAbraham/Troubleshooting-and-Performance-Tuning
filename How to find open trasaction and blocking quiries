how to findout open trasactions that are blocking queries?

1. DBCC OPENTRAN
    --this gives you ONLY the oldest open transaction. If you have multiple open trasactions, this method will not give you that information
    
 2. To get all the open trasactions, we can use the following queries 
    
    thsi gives you session ID, login name, database context, transaction begin time, 
    how many log records have been generated by the transaction, how much log space has been taken up by those log records, 
    how much log space has been reserved in case the transaction rolls back,
    the last T-SQL that was executed in the context of the transaction,
    the last query plan that was executed (only for currently executing plans)
      
                  SELECT
                  [s_tst].[session_id],
                  [s_es].[login_name] AS [Login Name],
                  DB_NAME (s_tdt.database_id) AS [Database],
                  [s_tdt].[database_transaction_begin_time] AS [Begin Time],
                  [s_tdt].[database_transaction_log_bytes_used] AS [Log Bytes],
                  [s_tdt].[database_transaction_log_bytes_reserved] AS [Log Rsvd],
                  [s_est].text AS [Last T-SQL Text],
                  [s_eqp].[query_plan] AS [Last Plan]
              FROM sys.dm_tran_database_transactions [s_tdt]
              JOIN sys.dm_tran_session_transactions [s_tst] ON [s_tst].[transaction_id] = [s_tdt].[transaction_id]
              JOIN sys.[dm_exec_sessions] [s_es] ON [s_es].[session_id] = [s_tst].[session_id]
              JOIN sys.dm_exec_connections [s_ec] ON [s_ec].[session_id] = [s_tst].[session_id]
              LEFT OUTER JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests [s_er] ON [s_er].[session_id] = [s_tst].[session_id]
              CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text ([s_ec].[most_recent_sql_handle]) AS [s_est]
              OUTER APPLY sys.dm_exec_query_plan ([s_er].[plan_handle]) AS [s_eqp]
              ORDER BY [Begin Time] ASC;
              GO
              
              
 ----------------------
 once the process is identifies, we can take the following measures
 1. contact the application owner and tell them to commit or rollback or kill the query
 2. if not we can kill the procces using the KILL <ProcessID> or we can kill it from the activity monitor from the OS
